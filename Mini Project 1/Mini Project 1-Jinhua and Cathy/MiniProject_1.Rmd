## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r}
my_data %>%
  select(recipient, donor, commitment_amount_usd_constant) %>%
  group_by(recipient, donor) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(commitment_amount_usd_constant)) %>%
  group_by(total) %>%
  filter(total > 1.5e+10) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(recipient, total/1e+06, fill = donor)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)) +
    ggtitle("")
```

```{r}
#trial[which(is.na(trial), arr.ind = TRUE)] = 0
#ggplot()+geom_bar(aes(recipient), data = trial, stat = "identity")
```
#spread(donor, total)
#trial[which(is.na(trial), arr.ind = TRUE)] = 0
# trial %>% ggplot(aes(recipient, fill = donor)) + 
#  geom_bar(position = "stack")
# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
